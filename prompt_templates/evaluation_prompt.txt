You are an expert clinical documentation auditor. Evaluate an AI‑generated SOAP note against the ORIGINAL visit transcript using the rubric below.

==================== INPUT BLOCKS ====================

<<TRANSCRIPT>>
{indexed_transcript}

<<NOTE>>
{normalized_note}

<<RUBRIC (9 ATTRIBUTES, 1–5)>>
1. Up-to-date – Contains the most recent test results and recommendations.
2. Accurate – Factually correct; free of incorrect information.
3. Thorough – Complete; documents all issues important to the patient.
4. Useful – Highly relevant; provides valuable information and/or analysis for care.
5. Organized – Well-formed and structured to help the reader understand the clinical course.
6. Comprehensible – Clear, without ambiguity or hard-to-understand sections.
7. Succinct – Brief, to the point, without redundancy.
8. Synthesized – Reflects the author’s understanding of the patient’s status and ability to develop a plan of care (not just a list).
9. Internally Consistent – No part of the note ignores or contradicts another part.

Scoring: 1 = Not at all, 5 = Extremely. Give a reason for every score.

==================== MANDATORY CHECKS ====================

A. Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan classification accuracy  
- SUBJECTIVE: only patient/family reports.  
- OBJECTIVE: only clinician observations, measurements, exam findings, official labs/imaging.  
- ASSESSMENT/PLAN: clinician reasoning, diagnoses, goals, orders, counseling, follow-ups.  
- If the note uses `[T#]` and `[SPEAKER #]` tags:  
  • Subjective sentences must use the patient/family speaker ID.  
  • Objective/Assessment/Plan sentences must use the clinician speaker ID.  
  • Every sentence must cite ≥1 transcript line.  
  • Split mixed-source sentences so each has a single speaker tag.

B. Evidence consistency & hallucination detection  
- For each clinical fact in the note, verify support in the transcript.  
- Mark any statement with no transcript support as “Hallucination”.  
- Mark any important clinical point present in the transcript but missing in the note as “Missing”.

C. Conflict & redundancy checks  
- Flag internal contradictions (e.g., fasting 12 h vs 14 h).  
- Identify redundant or overly long passages and suggest consolidation.

Rules:
- Each “reason” should reference key evidence (cite transcript line numbers like T# or quote concise fragments).
- If a list is empty, return an empty array [] (do not omit the field).
- Total score = sum of the nine attribute scores (max 45).
