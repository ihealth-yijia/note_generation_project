You are a medical documentation formatting expert. Please reformat the following SOAP note according to the specified style requirements while maintaining clinical accuracy and completeness.

**Current SOAP Note:**
{current_note}

**Format Requirements:**
- Detail Level: {detail_level}  # brief/standard/detailed/comprehensive  
- Organization Style: {organization_style}  # paragraph/bullet_point

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (Must Follow):**
1. **Accuracy First**: NEVER introduce contradictions or factual errors during reformatting
2. **Completeness Protection**: Do not remove any clinically significant information, regardless of word count targets
3. **Consistency Check**: Ensure all statements within the note are internally consistent
4. **Evidence Preservation**: MUST preserve ALL transcript tags in EXACT format [T#,T#-T#][SPEAKER #]

**Transcript Reference Format Requirements:**
- Each sentence MUST end with the exact citation format: [T#,T#-T#][SPEAKER #]
- Example correct format: Patient reports difficulty urinating [T23-T25][SPEAKER 1]
- Example incorrect format: Patient reports difficulty urinating T23-T25
- NEVER omit the square brackets [ ] around transcript numbers
- NEVER omit the [SPEAKER #] designation
- Maintain exact spacing and punctuation as shown in the original note
- In Subjective section, avoid repetitive "Patient reports" - start directly with the clinical information
- Use concise phrasing while maintaining clinical accuracy

**Detail Level Guidelines (Flexible based on content importance):**
- **Brief**: Focus on primary diagnosis and critical findings (~300 words, but exceed if clinically necessary)
- **Standard**: Complete clinical picture with key details (~300-700 words)
- **Detailed**: Comprehensive documentation (~700-1200 words)
- **Comprehensive**: Exhaustive documentation (1200+ words)

**Organization Style Requirements:**

**Paragraph Style:**
- Use complete paragraphs and flowing sentences
- Maintain smooth information flow for easy reading
- Preserve traditional medical documentation narrative format
- **MANDATORY citation format**: Each sentence must end with [T#,T#-T#][SPEAKER #]

**Paragraph Organization Guidelines:**
- **Subjective Section**: Organize into 3-4 focused paragraphs:
  - Paragraph 1: Chief complaint and primary symptoms
  - Paragraph 2: Medical history, procedures, and medications
  - Paragraph 3: Review of systems and symptom denials
  - Paragraph 4: Social history, lifestyle factors, and family history
- **Objective Section**: Organize into 2-3 focused paragraphs:
  - Paragraph 1: Laboratory results and diagnostic findings
  - Paragraph 2: Physical examination findings
  - Paragraph 3: Procedures and interventions performed today (if applicable)
- **Assessment Section**: Organize into 2-3 focused paragraphs:
  - Paragraph 1: Primary diagnosis and main clinical issues
  - Paragraph 2: Secondary diagnoses and comorbidities
  - Paragraph 3: Risk factors and monitoring needs (if applicable)
- **Plan Section**: Organize into 2-3 focused paragraphs:
  - Paragraph 1: Primary treatment plans and medication management
  - Paragraph 2: Secondary interventions and preventive measures
  - Paragraph 3: Follow-up arrangements and patient education

**Paragraph Length Guidelines:**
- Each paragraph should contain 3-6 related sentences
- Avoid single-sentence paragraphs unless clinically justified
- Avoid paragraphs longer than 8-10 sentences
- Group related clinical information within the same paragraph
- Use paragraph breaks to separate different clinical topics or themes

**Bullet Point Style:**
- Use bullet points (•) for clear organization
- Keep each point focused but complete (1-2 lines preferred)
- Ensure logical flow within sections
- **MANDATORY citation format**: • Content description [T#,T#-T#][SPEAKER #]

**Quality Safeguards:**
- If reformatting creates any contradiction, preserve the original accurate version
- If word count targets conflict with clinical completeness, prioritize completeness
- Cross-check that no important clinical facts are lost during reformatting
- Verify that Assessment and Plan sections remain actionable and complete
- Ensure all four SOAP sections (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) are included

**Quality Control Checklist:**
Before outputting, verify that:
- Every sentence has proper citation format [T#][SPEAKER #] or [T#-T#][SPEAKER #]

- No clinical contradictions exist
- All critical information is preserved

**FINAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:**
