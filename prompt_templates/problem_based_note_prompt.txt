"""🚨 MANDATORY: Read this rule 3 times before writing:
HPI/ROS = Patient/family SAYS  |  PHYSICAL EXAM = Doctor SEES/MEASURES

You are tasked with writing a Problem Based Primary Clinic Note.

## COMPLETE PROBLEM BASED PRIMARY CLINIC NOTE TEMPLATE - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

**HPI (History of Present Illness):**

**📝 EHR WRITING STANDARDS:**

**Writing Perspective:**
- Write from physician's first-person perspective for EHR documentation
- Use active voice: """"Prescribed..."""" """"Counseled..."""" """"Discussed...""""
- Use passive voice when appropriate: """"Patient counseled on..."""" """"Medication prescribed...""""
- Never use third-person: avoid """"doctor,"""" """"physician,"""" """"provider"""" references

**Correct EHR Writing Style:**
✅ """"Counseled patient on low-sodium diet""""
✅ """"Prescribed Norco 5mg for pain management""""  
✅ """"Patient reports chest pain""""
✅ """"Blood pressure measured at 140/90""""
✅ """"Discussed risks and benefits of procedure""""
✅ """"Labs ordered to assess kidney function""""
✅ """"Patient advised to return if symptoms worsen""""

**Incorrect - Avoid Third Person:**
❌ """"Doctor counseled patient on diet""""
❌ """"Physician prescribed medication""""
❌ """"Provider discussed risks""""
❌ """"The doctor noted...""""
❌ """"Doctor states...""""
❌ """"Physician contacted lab for additional studies""""

**Content Classification Examples:**

**HPI Examples (Patient Reports):**
✅ """"Patient reports daily headaches for 2 weeks""""
✅ """"States pain is 7/10, sharp, worse with movement""""
✅ """"Denies chest pain or shortness of breath""""
✅ """"Family history of diabetes in mother""""
✅ """"Reports taking medication as prescribed""""
✅ """"Describes work stress affecting sleep""""

**Physical Exam Examples (Doctor Observes/Measures):**  
✅ """"BP 140/90, HR 72, temp 98.6°F""""
✅ """"Lung sounds clear bilaterally on auscultation""""
✅ """"No acute distress observed""""
✅ """"Lab results: glucose 120 mg/dL""""
✅ """"Palpable mass in right lower quadrant""""
✅ """"Patient appears anxious during interview""""

**🚨 COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENTS:**
**All Clinical Discussions Must Be Captured:**
- Include ALL medical topics discussed during the encounter, including brief mentions and """"by the way"""" comments
- Document all preventive care discussions (vaccines, screenings, lifestyle counseling) under appropriate problem/issue
- Record all medication discussions, including those declined or deferred
- Include all follow-up planning discussions and scheduling conflicts mentioned
- Document patient education provided by physician
- Include physician's clinical reasoning and patient counseling when evident
**For Partially Mentioned Information:**
- If specific values are discussed but not clearly stated, note """"elevated"""" or """"high"""" with context
- If examination findings are implied through physician actions, document what was performed
- When physician references prior results, include the timeframe and general findings mentioned

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONTENT CLASSIFICATION:
**HPI = ALL patient/family reports, including:**
- Functional status as described: """"patient reports difficulty walking"""", """"family states dependent for ADLs""""
- Diet habits as reported: """"patient eats 3 meals/day"""", """"family prepares meals"""", """"reports low vegetables""""
- Sleep patterns as described: """"sleeps well"""", """"reports restless nights""""
- Symptoms as reported: """"denies pain"""", """"reports fatigue""""
- Medical history as stated: """"had surgery 2 years ago""""
- Weight/vitals as REPORTED by patient: """"patient states weight is 150 lbs""""
- Any medication use reported by the patient or family must go in the HPI section, not Physical Exam, unless verified by the clinician or chart. **IMPORTANT: Clearly distinguish between ""currently taking"" vs ""discontinued"" vs ""unable to obtain"" medications. When patient says ""not taking pain meds"" but mentions sleep medication, record both statements separately.**

**Medication Documentation Standards:**
- Record EXACTLY as stated in transcript - do not convert tablet counts to mg
- If transcript says ""half tablet twice daily"" → write ""half tablet twice daily""  
- Only include mg if explicitly mentioned in transcript
- NEVER assume standard drug strengths to add missing dosage information

**PHYSICAL EXAM = ONLY what doctor observes/measures/finds:**
✅ ""No abnormalities on abdominal examination""
✅ ""No tenderness elicited on palpation"" 
❌ NEVER include: Patient's self-reported findings during exam as physician findings
❌ Wrong: ""Mild tenderness noted"" when doctor found nothing
**If patient reports pain during self-examination but doctor finds nothing:**
✅ HPI: ""Patient reports tenderness when self-palpating abdomen""
✅ Physical Exam: ""No abnormalities on physician examination of abdomen""

- Include specific vital signs and measurements when mentioned in the transcript
- Document detailed physical examination findings rather than general statements
- Record exact blood pressure readings if provided (e.g., """"Initial BP: [X/X], repeat BP: [X/X]"""")
- Specify examination techniques used (e.g., """"auscultation,"""" """"palpation,"""" """"inspection"""")
- Completed lab results with specific numbers from official reports
- Current medication list (as documented medical facts)
- Appearance/behavior observed during visit: """"appears comfortable"""", """"no acute distress noted""""

**Assessment & Plan Section Precision:**
- Use precise medical terminology that reflects the actual clinical findings
- For historical conditions, specify """"prior"""" or """"history of"""" rather than assuming active diagnosis
- When referencing imaging findings, use accurate descriptors (e.g., """"chronic cerebral infarcts on MRI"""" rather than """"cerebrovascular accident"""")
- Distinguish between confirmed diagnoses and clinical impressions
- Organize by specific problems/issues addressed during the visit

🚫 **NEVER PUT IN PHYSICAL EXAM:**
- """"Patient reports..."""" or """"Family states..."""" or """"Patient describes...""""
- Self-reported weight, blood pressure, or vital signs
- Functional status descriptions from patient/family
- Diet habits/Sleep pattern described by patient/family
- Patient's own glucose readings or home monitoring results

## VISIT TYPE CONSIDERATIONS:

### **PHONE/VIDEO VISITS:**
- Most information goes to HPI (patient reports)
- Physical Exam section will be very minimal (usually medication review only)
- Patient-reported vitals/weight go to HPI, not Physical Exam
- Only include what doctor can actually observe via phone/video

### **IN-PERSON VISITS:**
- Physical Exam section can include actual physical examination findings
- Measured vital signs go to Physical Exam
- Observed appearance and behavior go to Physical Exam

**🎯 ACCURACY REMINDERS:**
- Avoid adding details not mentioned (e.g., don't specify """"right hip"""" if laterality not stated)
- Use exact terminology from transcript when possible
- If uncertain about details, use general terms rather than specific ones
- 🚨 CRITICAL: When transcript shows medical clarification or correction, document the FINAL clarified information, not the initial misunderstanding

**🔍 QUALITY CHECK - Before finalizing, ensure:**
- No important clinical discussions were omitted from any section
- All preventive care topics discussed are documented under appropriate problem/issue
- All medication discussions included, even if declined
- Patient's preferences and physician's recommendations are both captured
- Follow-up planning and scheduling conflicts are documented
- The note tells the complete story of what happened during the encounter, organized by specific problems/issues
- Each problem/issue has appropriate HPI content and corresponding Assessment & Plan

**🔍 FINAL CLASSIFICATION CHECK:**
Before submitting, verify EACH vital sign entry:
- Is this what patient SAID or what doctor MEASURED?
- If patient said it → HPI
- If doctor measured it → Physical Exam
- NEVER combine both in one statement
- Did I add any mg dosages not explicitly mentioned in the transcript?

📌 NOTE TRACING REQUIREMENTS – STRICT COMPLIANCE REQUIRED (REVISED)

For EACH sentence in the Problem Based Note, do BOTH:

1. **Transcript Line Index Tagging**  
   - Use `[T#]` or ranges like `[T23–T25]`.  
   - For non‑contiguous lines, use commas: `[T23–T25,T27,T30–T32]`.  
   - Include **all** lines (patient or doctor) that informed this sentence.

2. **Speaker Identification Tagging**  
   - Immediately after the transcript tag, add **ONE** `[SPEAKER #]` to denote the **original source / narrative voice of the information in this sentence**.  
   - If multiple sources are mixed, **split the sentence** so each has a single correct tag.  
   - **Section–Speaker Consistency Rules:**  
     - **HPI / Review of Systems:** tag must be patient/family (e.g., `[SPEAKER 1]`).  
     - **Physical Exam / Assessment & Plan:** tag must be clinician (e.g., `[SPEAKER 0]`).  
   - You may still cite patient lines in `[T#]` to justify an Assessment/Plan statement, but keep the speaker tag as the clinician.

3. **Sanity Checks (Model must self-verify)**  
   - If an HPI/ROS sentence has a clinician tag → reclassify or split.  
   - If a Physical Exam/Assessment & Plan sentence has a patient tag → reclassify or split.  
   - Every sentence must have ≥1 `[T#]`; tagged speaker should logically match at least one of those lines' true sources.

4. **Strict Role Mapping at End of Note**  
   - Title: **""Speaker Role Mapping""**.  
   - List ONLY the speaker IDs that appear in `[SPEAKER #]` tags.  
   - Unknown roles use `[UNKNOWN]`.  
   - Do NOT list unused speakers.

**✅ Example (Correct):**  
**1. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia**
Patient reports occasional bleeding and burning in the rectal area after long drives as a courier. [T124–T135][SPEAKER 1]  

**Physical Exam:**
Hemorrhoids present on exam; not inflamed, steroids not required today. [T298–T304][SPEAKER 0]  

**Assessment & Plan:**
**1. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia**
* Primary issue is BPH with incomplete emptying; symptoms worsened after stopping terazosin. [T69–T73,T361–T380][SPEAKER 0]

**Speaker Role Mapping:**  
[SPEAKER 0]: doctor  
[SPEAKER 1]: patient

🚨 FINAL REMINDER: 
- Patient/family REPORTS = HPI/Review of Systems (even if about medical facts)
- Doctor OBSERVES/MEASURES = Physical Exam
- When in doubt about classification, it probably belongs in HPI
