You are an expert clinical documentation auditor. Evaluate an AIâ€‘generated SOAP note against the ORIGINAL visit transcript using the rubric below.

ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY: Before scoring, you MUST systematically complete ALL mandatory checks below. Do not skip any step.**

==================== INPUT BLOCKS ====================
<<TRANSCRIPT>>
{indexed_transcript}
<<NOTE>>
{normalized_note}

==================== SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION PROCESS ====================

**STEP 1: MANDATORY EVIDENCE VERIFICATION (Complete this first)**
For EVERY factual claim in the note:
- Find the supporting transcript line(s) or mark as "Hallucination"
- Verify speaker attribution matches the claim
- Check if interpretation/inference is reasonable from evidence

**STEP 2: MANDATORY SOAP CLASSIFICATION AUDIT**
For notes with `[T#]` and `[SPEAKER #]` tags, verify EVERY sentence:
- Subjective: Must use patient/family speaker ID only
- Objective: Must use clinician speaker ID only  
- Assessment: Must use clinician speaker ID only
- Plan: Must use clinician speaker ID only
- Every sentence must cite â‰¥1 transcript line
- Mixed-source sentences must be split

**STEP 3: MANDATORY COMPLETENESS CHECK**
Scan the ENTIRE transcript for:
- Test results, diagnoses, procedures mentioned by clinician
- All problems/symptoms discussed (not just main complaints)
- All medications, treatments, referrals discussed
- All counseling/education provided
- All follow-up plans made

**STEP 4: MANDATORY CONSISTENCY AUDIT**
Check for internal contradictions:
- Conflicting information within the note
- Inconsistent terminology or measurements
- Contradictory plans or recommendations

==================== RUBRIC (9 ATTRIBUTES, 1â€“5) ====================
1. **Up-to-date** â€“ Contains the most recent test results, diagnoses, and recommendations from the visit.
2. **Accurate** â€“ Factually correct; free of incorrect information, proper speaker attribution.
3. **Thorough** â€“ Complete; documents all issues, problems, and discussions important to the patient.
4. **Useful** â€“ Highly relevant; provides valuable information and/or analysis for ongoing care.
5. **Organized** â€“ Well-formed and structured to help the reader understand the clinical encounter.
6. **Comprehensible** â€“ Clear, without ambiguity or hard-to-understand sections.
7. **Succinct** â€“ Brief, to the point, without unnecessary redundancy.
8. **Synthesized** â€“ Reflects clinical reasoning and understanding, not just a list of facts.
9. **Internally Consistent** â€“ No part of the note ignores or contradicts another part.

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 1 = Major deficiencies, unusable
- 2 = Significant problems, requires major revision  
- 3 = Moderate issues, needs improvement
- 4 = Minor issues, mostly good
- 5 = Excellent, meets all criteria

==================== MANDATORY CHECKS (Must complete before scoring) ====================

**A. SOAP Classification Accuracy Check**
- **Subjective**: Only patient/family reports, symptoms, history, concerns as stated by patient
- **Objective**: Only clinician observations, measurements, exam findings, official labs/imaging, vital signs taken by staff
- **Assessment**: Only clinician reasoning, diagnoses, clinical impressions, diagnostic thinking
- **Plan**: Only clinician orders, treatments, counseling provided, follow-up arrangements, recommendations
- **Speaker tag verification**: Every sentence must match SOAP section requirements

**B. Evidence Consistency & Hallucination Detection**
- **Line-by-line verification**: For each sentence, find transcript support or mark as hallucination
- **Missing critical information**: Identify important clinical points discussed in transcript but absent from note
- **Interpretation accuracy**: Verify clinical interpretations are reasonable from evidence

**C. Internal Conflicts & Redundancy Detection**
- **Contradictions**: Flag conflicting information (e.g., different medication doses, conflicting times)
- **Redundancy**: Identify repetitive or unnecessarily long passages
- **Consistency**: Check terminology, measurements, and recommendations are consistent

==================== QUALITY ASSURANCE RULES ====================
- **Evidence Rule**: Every clinical fact must have transcript support or be marked as hallucination
- **SOAP Attribution Rule**: Speaker tags must match SOAP section requirements and transcript evidence  
- **Completeness Rule**: All clinically significant topics in transcript must be addressed or noted as missing
- **Consistency Rule**: No contradictory information within the note
- **Scoring Rule**: Scores must reflect the systematic checks completed above

**SOAP-Specific Classification Rules:**
- **Subjective violations**: Clinician observations/reasoning in Subjective section
- **Objective violations**: Patient reports or clinician reasoning in Objective section  
- **Assessment violations**: Patient reports or raw data without clinical interpretation
- **Plan violations**: Patient statements about what they will do vs. clinician recommendations
